## 🛡️ About Me

I’m a cybersecurity graduate passionate about **ethical hacking, security testing, and building realistic attack/defense labs**.  
Whether it’s scanning a network, enumerating services, or simulating a real-world exploit chain, I focus on *practical, hands-on skills* backed by strong theoretical knowledge.

I believe that **every scan tells a story** and that breaking systems (ethically) is the best way to understand how to protect them.
